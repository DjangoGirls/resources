NOT ACCEPTED: Django Girls <city>

Body:

Dear applicant,

Unfortunately we couldn't fit you in the workshop at this time. To be able to give personal guidance to each participant, we could only take a fraction of the applicants.

Remember: this doesn't mean that you're not good enough. Sometimes it means that you already have too much experience (and you should apply as a coach, not a beginner!), sometimes it means that there is (or will be very soon) another Django Girls event near you. We also received many more applications than we could ever accommodate. If you wish to receive a personal feedback, please reply to this message, we will try to do our best. Warmest hugs to you!

The Django Girls project is constantly organizing new events, so please don't hesitate applying again to another event. Check out our website: http://djangogirls.org/ and follow http://twitter.com/djangogirls or http://facebook.com/djangogirls for more information.

All our materials are free and open source, so you can try doing the tutorial on your own: http://tutorial.djangogirls.org/. If you are motivated to learn, you can also try out <meetups for women like Pyladies in the city>.

Also, there is always a chance that we might have some last-minute cancellations, so we might contact you closer to the workshop date if space becomes available.

Good luck!
Django Girls <city>
